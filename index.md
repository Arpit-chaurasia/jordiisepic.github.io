# Introduction

This is my first site ever and it's hosted with GitHub Pages.

You can view the project on GitHub by clicking the button above!

This is just a dumping ground for my projects and such whenever I decide to put something up.

# What I do

Not much, I hack my consoles and mess with homebrew, but never create anything.

I spend my time learning basic Python and making this site.
